\section{Preparations}

In this lab you will use a set of predefined Python functions to
build and manipulate decision trees.  In order to run this, you
need to have Python installed.  We also use the Qt graphics library,
PyQt, for plotting. PyQt comes in different versions 4 or 5. For
Mac users version 5 is recommended.
